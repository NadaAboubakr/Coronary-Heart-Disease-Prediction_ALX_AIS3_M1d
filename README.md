# Predicting the Ten-Year Risk of Developing Heart Disease Using Machine Learning
This project involves predicting the ten-year risk of developing coronary heart disease (CHD) using machine learning models. The dataset used is the Framingham Heart Study dataset, and the model is built using Python libraries. The final prediction model is built and evaluated in Jupyter notebooks with visualizations and proper data preprocessing.

## Introduction
This project aims to predict whether a patient is likely to develop coronary heart disease within ten years using a dataset of health-related metrics. The model leverages data preprocessing, feature scaling, and machine learning algorithms to predict the risk of coronary heart disease (CHD).

Key steps of the project include:
- Data cleaning and preprocessing using Python.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) through visualizations.
- Building and evaluating machine learning models.
- GUI development (to be added) for an easy-to-use interface for prediction.

## Setup
Prerequisites:
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
- GUI Library: (e.g., Tkinter or PyQt) will be added once the GUI is integrated.

Installation Steps:
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/NadaAboubakr/Coronary-Heart-Disease-Prediction
2. Install the required Python libraries:
    ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage
1. Data Cleaning and Modeling:
- Open the `Data_Cleaning and Modeling.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter.
- Follow the steps for data preprocessing, feature selection, model training, and evaluation.
  
2. Data Visualization:
- Open the `Visualization.ipynb` notebook to explore the dataset and generate key visualizations such as histograms, countplots, and correlation heatmaps.

3. Predictions via GUI (coming soon):
- A GUI application will be added to simplify the prediction process. Users will input patient details (e.g., age, cholesterol, blood pressure), and the model will output the risk of developing coronary heart disease within the next ten years.
